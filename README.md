# Hudl Login Tests

This is a suite of 4 basic tests for the Hudl login page.

1. Testing Login with Valid Email and Password (Please replace the text within emailStr and passwordStr variables with your own valid email and password)
2. Testing a Log Out
3. Testing Login with Invalid Email and Password
4. Testing Login when No Email or Password are given

Attempting to show I'm comfortable writing scripts in different formats as needed.

** I also attempted to write a case testing the 'Remember Me' functionality, but kept getting an Invalid Session ID error. I attached my script and the pickle file I created that stores the browser cookies for the session to this repo. If you want to take a look at that and possible give some feedback that would be cool. If not, no worries, I was just trying it!
